    "2. **Intervention**. Adds an indicator term for the \"intervention\", which starts 12 days after the deaths  threshold is reached. This model adds flexibility that can \"bend\" the linear and quadratic term. It doesn't allow a mean shift, so it's a *hockey stick* model.\n",
    "3. **NCHS simple**. Adds an indicator variable for the NCHS (National Center for Health Statistics) category for each county. The NCHS variable has 6 levels.\n",
    "4. **NCHS interaction**. Adds an interaction term between intervention and the NCHS indicator. It can alter the intensity of the interaction trend shift based on NCHS category.\n",
    "5. **Earliness**. Adds an interaction term between the intervention and number of days between the intervention and the theshold (the time at which $t=0$). It can alter the intensity of the interaction trend shift based on how early the intervention took place."
